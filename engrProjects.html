          <h2>MASA Thermocouple Board</h2>
          <div class="container">
          <p><u>Description:</u> I recently joined the MASA (Michigan Aeronautical Science Association), as a part of the Avionics subteam. 
            The first project I was assigned was to design a board to read & amplify thermocouples and send the data to the data collection computer.
            I designed the board in Altium, with a ton of help from Evan Eidt, and finished construction in November 2023. 
            There have been a few issues, mainly as a result of my lack of knowledge and experience, but it seems to be providing some value, and was a great learning experience.
          <br><br>
          The board uses 16 individual OP Amp based amplifiers for each thermocouple, each with a variable gain, that feeds to an NI DAQ, which is read by a computer.
          It also has 4 separate temperature measurement ICs, each of which are also fed to the DAQ pc over SPI, then USB.

            <h2>DSLR Camera Photometry and Star Tracking</h2>
            <div class="container">
            <p><u>Description:</u> This project had a couple of aspects: 1) Determining the maximum possible accuracy of a DSLR camera for photometry and 2) Building a star tracker to help increase the accuracy of the DSLR without significantly adding to the cost of the system. I did a number of tests, varying different aspects of the camera settings, like ISO, shutter speed, target positioning, and number of photos taken in a series. <br> The image on the right is a model of the star tracker I designed and built, which ended up significantly increasing the maximum shutter speed without causing star trails from around 15-30s to over 3 minutes. </p>

          <h2>Micromouse</h2>
          <div class="container">
          <p><u>Description:</u> This is a custom maze robot built by myself and a teammate. Most of the physical design, such as the chassis, Arduino, power supply, distance sensors, motors, and encoders were designed or put together by me, and my teammate focused on the maze solving algorithm and circuitry. This robot was unique in that the distance sensors, chassis, and navigation algorithm were all completely custom built and designed.</p>

            <h2>Frog Call Recording and Classification System</h2>
            <div class="container">
            <p><u>Description:</u> This is a system I created as a sophomore to be able to identify frogs from audio recordings as a way to monitor the health of wetlands. The system, like many that I work on, had two main parts: a physical device to record clips of the wetland, and a program to analyze the clips to attempt to isolate and identify frog calls. As a part of building the recording device, I designed a case for the Raspberry Pi, microphone, and battery to keep them dry, and experimented with an attachment to power the Pi only when calls needed to be taken to improve battery life. The program was much more challenging, though, it was my first real experience with audio recording and analysis, and determining how to process the recording efficiently and match them against the many species of frogs is a problem I am not finished with. I did find it very interesting throughout my research and testing how widely applicable of a system this is, though I tested with frogs there are many possibilities.</p>

            <h2>Improved Spatial Positioning System</h2>
            <div class="container">
            <p><u>Description:</u> The Improved Spatial Positioning System (ISPS) was a system I created as part of a team as an alternative to traditional GPS systems. ISPS used similar underlying principles to GPS, but on a much smaller scale to allow for the same accuracy as high end GPS units with a much lower cost. Our system used a laser rangefinder to find distances between known points and the target and a program which computed the relative location of the target in the testing area using a mathematical technique known as trilateration, and was accurate down to a few inches, similar to that of the multi-thousand dollar GPS receiver we tested against.</p>

            <h2>Internet of Things Robot</h2>
            <div class="container">
            <p><u>Description:</u>  This is a robot that a team of five worked on for the Internet of Things challenge at the National Robotics Challenge. This was a four hour long event, and the work was divided up such that some team members built the frame of the robot, others wired the components, and others worked on the software the robot used to be controlled over the internet and send information. My main role was working on the navigation of the robot, using GPS, as well as working on the camera and component mounting.<br>The limited time available to build was the most challenging aspect, we had to plan thoroughly each member's contribution to the device. We did work efficiently, though, and even experimented with adding features and sensors we had not tested ahead of time, a major benefit of our robot. The category of device we could built was not dictated by the challenge, so choosing the four wheeled robot was a major decision for the team, and one that worked well in terms of versatility and our prior knowledge.</p>
