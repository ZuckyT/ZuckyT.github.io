          <h2>Recent Project: MASA Thermocouple Board</h2>
          <p>I recently joined the MASA (Michigan Aeronautical Science Association), as a part of the Avionics subteam. 
            The first project I was assigned was to design a board to read & amplify thermocouples and send the data to the data collection computer.
            I designed the board in Altium, with a ton of help from Evan Eidt, and finished construction in November 2023. 
            There have been a few issues, mainly as a result of my lack of knowledge and experience, but it seems to be providing some value, and was a great learning experience.

        <h2>Entry 2</h2>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
